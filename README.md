Going through the building blocks for a plugin, publicly.

1. We want a simple application that allows the user to output a MIDI file after fiddling with a slider or a text field.
2. the slider and text field shall be linked so that the values
3. validate the text input, else result is 0.

TODO:

- [X] initial setup of audio/MIDI plugin
- [ ] add 2 components to view : slider, text field
- [ ] add change broadcast/listeners 
- [ ] utilize value tree state
