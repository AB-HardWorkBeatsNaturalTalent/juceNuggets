Going through the building blocks for a plugin, publicly.

1. We want a simple application that allows the user to output a MIDI file after fiddling with a slider and pressing export button
2. the sliders shall listen for each other's changes

TODO:

- [X] initial setup of audio/MIDI plugin
- [ ] add 2 components to view that listen to each other: slider 1, slider 2
- [ ] add change broadcast/listeners 
- [ ] utilize value tree state
- [ ] add export button -> midi file output
